                            It is the grace of God that has done this for you and I. In reciprocation of the grace of God upon us, we need to appreciate God’s grace by living in the Spirit and not in the flesh.
                            There is a question to us and the answer nothing good but more shame and death.</p>
                            
                            <p>Make it your aim not to do those things that brings shame and death this year.
                            Live and walk in the spirit and totally hate and abhor the flesh and its work.  In doing this, we become God’s people and God in return take pleasure in us and beautify us with salvation [health, wealth, wisdom, blessings and every good thing].</P>
