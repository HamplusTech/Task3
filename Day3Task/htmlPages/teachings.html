                        It is the grace of God that has done this for you and I. In reciprocation of the grace of God upon us, we need to appreciate God’s grace by living in the Spirit and not in the flesh.
                        There is a question to us and the answer nothing good but more shame and death.</p>
                        
                        <p>Make it your aim not to do those things that brings shame and death this year.
                        Live and walk in the spirit and totally hate and abhor the flesh and its work.  In doing this, we become God’s people and God in return take pleasure in us and beautify us with salvation [health, wealth, wisdom, blessings and every good thing].</P>

                <div id="message"><p>God’s Image, You can see that it I very easy to sin and to avoid sinning is also very easy. It all requires you to do the good you know. This is the judgment and there is nothing more.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you know that you ought to help someone and you didn’t, then you have sinned. This goes to other things and it affect our daily living.</P>
                        <p>In this time of advance knowledge and massive revelation of God’s word, none can comfortably say that he or she does not know what is good to do. Let me surprise you that even if you claim not to know, in Christ just as in the law court, ignorance isn’t an excuse – Luke 12:47 – 48.</p>
                        <p>In doing the good you know, comes beautification – John 13:17. May God empower us all to do good always – Amen. Shalom!

                            <p>Here is a simple step to our restoration and establishment in this year and in life. Just simply to return unto God and do His commandments.</p>
                            <p>What are God’s commandments? His commands are simply to love God and to love human. – Luke 10:27 Mark 12:29-30.</p>
                            <p>God is merciful and He is ready to welcome you back into the fold of His people. Don’t dwell in the sins and errors you have committed and don’t repeat those sins and errors.</p>
                            <p>This year, make it your aim to return unto God in areas that you have left His path; and do His commandments then you will testify of restoration and establishment.</P>
                            <p>God bless and enlarge you. Shalom!
